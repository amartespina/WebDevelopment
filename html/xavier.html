    <h1> XAVIER HTML </h1>
    <P> Professor X (Charles Francis Xavier) is a fictional character appearing in 
        American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is depicted as the
         founder and sometimes leader of the X-Men. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer
          Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The X-Men #1 (September 1963).

    <p> Xavier is a member of a subspecies of humans known as mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities.
         He is an exceptionally powerful telepath, who can read and control the minds of others. To both shelter
          and train mutants from around the world, he runs a private school in the X-Mansion in Salem Center, located
          in Westchester County, New York.[1] Xavier also strives to serve a greater good by promoting peaceful 
          coexistence and equality between humans and mutants in a world where zealous anti-mutant bigotry is
          widespread
    </p>

    <p>Throughout much of the character's history in comics, Xavier is a paraplegic using a standard or modified
        wheelchair. One of the world's most powerful mutant telepaths, Xavier is a scientific genius and a leading
        authority in genetics. He has devised Cerebro and other equipment to enhance psionic powers and detect and
        track people with the mutant gene
    </p>

    <p>Xavier's pacifist and assimilationist ideology and actions have often been contrasted with that of Magneto, 
    a mutant leader (initially characterized as a supervillain and later as a complex antihero) with whom Xavier 
    has a complicated relationship. Writer Chris Claremont, who originated Magneto's backstory as well as the relationship
    between the two men, modeled his characterization of Xavier on David Ben Gurion, and that of Magneto on Menachem 
    Begin.Later commentators have compared Xavier and his actions to Martin Luther King Jr. and the American civil rights struggle
