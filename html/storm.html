    <H1> STORM HTML </H1>
    <p>Storm is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
        The character was created by writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum, first appearing
         in Giant-Size X-Men #1 (May 1975). Descended from a long line of African witch-priestesses,
          Storm is a member of a fictional subspecies of humans born with superhuman abilities known 
          as mutants. She is able to control the weather and atmosphere and is considered to be one of 
          the most powerful mutants on the planet, and one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe.

    <p>Born Ororo Munroe to a tribal princess of Kenya and an African-American photojournalist father, 
        Storm is raised in Harlem, New York City, United States and Cairo, Egypt. She was made an orphan
         after her parents were killed in the midst of an Arabâ€“Israeli conflict. An incident at this time 
         also traumatized Munroe, leaving her with claustrophobia that she would struggle with for life. 
         Storm is a member of the X-Men, a group of mutant heroes fighting for peace and equal rights between 
         mutants and humans. Under the tutelage of a master thief an adolescent Munroe became a skilled pickpocket,
          the means of which she meets through coincidence the powerful mutant Professor X.

    <p>Professor X later convinces Munroe to join the X-Men and use her abilities 
        for a greater cause and purpose. Possessing natural leadership skills and formidable 
        powers of her own, Storm has led the X-Men at times and has been a member of teams such as the Avengers
         and the Fantastic Four as well. Storm is also part of one of the higher-profile romantic relationships 
        in all of comics. Having married childhood sweetheart and fellow superhero Black Panther, the ruler of the
        fictional African nation of Wakanda, Munroe was made queen consort through marriage. The title was lost however
        when the two later divorced</p>

         Created during the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Storm is the first major female character 
         of African descent in comics. She is regarded by some as being Marvel Comics' most important
          female superhero, having drawn favorable comparison to DC Comics' most famous female lead Wonder Woman.
           When Marvel and DC Comics published a DC vs. Marvel miniseries in 1996, Storm was pitted against Wonder
            Woman in a one-on-one battle and emerged victorious due to winning a popular vote amongst readers
